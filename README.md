# node-iiif-watermarker
Adds a watermark on top of a IIIF Image API server call via a node proxy server.

This proof of concept assumes you have a file called image01.jpg on a cantaloupe server on port 8182. Make sure to replace the info.json in this the image01.jpg folder with the one generated by your IIIF server before running this app. 

Next steps:

- Output unwatermarked images to a buffer instead of a file
- Make IIIF port the proxy pulls from editable by varibale
