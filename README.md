# node-iiif-watermarker
Adds a watermark on top of a IIIF Image API server call via a node proxy server.

This proof of concept assumes you have a file called image01.jpg on a cantaloupe server on port 8182.

To easily start up a IIIF server with an image01.jpg, use this [image viewer comparison](https://github.com/nationalarchives/image-viewer-comparison) repo, which will automatically create a IIIF Image API server and load three image viewers.

Make sure to replace the info.json in this repo's image01.jpg folder with the one generated by your
IIIF server before running this app. 

Next steps:

- Output unwatermarked images to a buffer instead of a file
- Make the IIIF port the proxy pulls images from editable by variable
